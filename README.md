This is the first repository so that I can learn how Git works!

Nic here, writing a little bit about myself. I'm really interested in the Python coding language, specifically for data science. I have a lot of MATLAB experience from my graduate school experience where I did research in Numerical Analysis. I have some experience with Python but want to become an expert!
